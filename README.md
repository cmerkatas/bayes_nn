Bayesian Neural Networks for binary classifcation.
The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm is used for posterior inference.

Functions: nn_forward, nn_predict, unpack and the example for classification are taken from the tutorial on Bayesian neural networks of the Turing language. https://turing.ml/

In the future, more MCMC algorithms will be added and regression capabilities will be implemented.
